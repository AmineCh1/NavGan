 - Restrictiveness: A variation of a specific set of dimensions in the input space Z should only affect a specific associated set of features in the output space S. [SAY THIS OUT LOUD]
- Consistency: Similarly, a visible variation of features in the output space S, should be easily tracable to a specific set of dimensions in the input space Z.[SAY THIS OUT LOUD]
